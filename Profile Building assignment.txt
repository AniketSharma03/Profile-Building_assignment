1.What is the difference between UI and UX? Explain in your own words.

Sol:UI refers to the visual elements and design of a product that users interact with. It encompasses the graphical layout, buttons, icons, and other visual elements that users see and interact with on the screen. 
UX, on the other hand, is a broader concept that encompasses the overall experience users have while interacting with a product. It goes beyond just the visual design and considers the entire user journey, from the moment a user first encounters the product to their ongoing interactions. 
Difference:UI is more about the look and feel of a product's interface, while UX is concerned with the overall experience a user has throughout their interaction with the product, taking into account usability, functionality, and user satisfaction.
